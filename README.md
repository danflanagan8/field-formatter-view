# Field Formatter View

Sometimes you have an entity reference that holds lots of references.
Often you want to sort or group those entities before displaying them.
This Field Formatter may be helpful in that situation. Select the "View"
Field Formatter and select a view from the list. When the field is
rendered, the entity ids are passed to the selected View as a contextual
filter; then the View is then rendered.
